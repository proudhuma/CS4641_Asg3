folder figures contains all used figures.

folder report contains the .tex file for the report.

plot.py is for ploting figures

clustering_em_all.py and clustering_km_all.py are the files for running expectation maximization and k means to do clustering(both on raw data and on data after dimension reduction). 

wine_km.py and wine_pca.py are the files for plotting data after applying k means clustering and PCA dimension reduction.

wine_nn_dr.py is the file for training neural network after dimension reduction.

wine_nn_cluster.py is the file for training neural network after clustering.
